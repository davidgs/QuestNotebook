    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, you'll need a few things installed and set up. This should be quick. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. QuestDB: To install Questdb you can see [Installation](https://questdb.io/getstarted) for complete instructions in case you want to use Docker, or `brew` on MacOS, but the easiest way is to download the binaries and run it directly. Instructions for that are [Here](https://questdb.io/docs/guideBinaries).\n",
    "2. Jupyter Notebooks: That's what this is. To run it, you should:\n",
    "    1. make **sure** you are running Python 3.x and _not_ Python 2.7. If you're in doubt, `python --version` will tell you.\n",
    "    2. install Jupyter Notebooks with `pip3 install --upgrade ipython jupyter`\n",
    "    3. make sure that the libraries we use in this tutorial are also installed with `pip3 install requests urlib matplotlib pandas`\n",
    "    4. clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/davidgs/QuestNotebook`)\n",
    "    5. in the repository directory run `jupyter notebook`\n",
    "   \n",
    "That will get you right back to a page like this that is interactive, allowing you to run the code and interact with the database yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get errors like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'` for any of the libraries you installed above, double-check to make sure that you are actually using Python 3.x `jupytper --path` will let you know if Jupyter is using 2.7 or 3.x"

    "## Create A Database\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need someplace to store our data, so let's create a test database where we can put some random data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a simple table with 5 columns, one of which is a `timestamp` \n",
    "\n",
    "The Create operation in QuestDB appends records to bottom of a table. If the table has a designated `timestamp`, new record timestamps must be superior or equal to the latest timestamp. Attempts to add a timestamp in middle of a table will result in a timestamp out of order error.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `cust_id` is the customer identifier. It uniquely identifies customer.\n",
    "* `balance_ccy` balance currency. We use `SYMBOL` here to avoid storing text against each record to save space and increase database performance.\n",
    "* `balance` is the current balance for customer and currency tuple.\n",
    "* `inactive` is used to flag deleted records.\n",
    "* `timestamp` timestamp in microseconds of the record. Note that if you receive the timestamp data as a string, it could also be inserted using `to_timestamp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should return a `200` status the first time you run it. If you run it more than once, subsequent runs will return `400` because the database already exists."
